## Resumable Process

Request | Endpoint      | Description                       |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|GET | `{id}/process/`        | starts running a long process |
|POST | `{id}/process/pause/` | pause long running process |
|POST | `{id}/process/cancel/` | cancel long running process |
|POST | `{id}/process/resume/` | resume a list of valid work types |

### Methodology
The client makes the `GET` request in order to start the long running process. The main thread dispatches a worker thread to tend to the request. The main thread exits with a response while the worker thread continues to run the process in background. This prevents timeouts. While the worker thread runs, a `POST` request can be made to pause, cancel and resume the process. 


## Resumable Download

Request | Endpoint                                                               | Description                       |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|GET | `download/?file_name={file_name}&bytes_read={bytes_read}` | file_name (**reqd**) should be a valid file name present at the server's Files directory and (**bytes_read**) should be an integer  |

### Reponse

```javascript
{
  "file_content" : str,
  "bytes_read" : int,
  "is_complete" : bool
}
```

### Methodology
The client makes multiple `GET` requests to the server. The server reads a chunk of file (no. of bytes which can be configured in settings.py) and returns the read `file_content` and the `bytes_read`. The client then makes the next `GET` request with the earlier received `bytes_read` param value and the server returns the next block of bytes. For all such requests, the `is_complete` param value is set to False. When the download process completes, the `is_complete` param is set to True indicating download is now complete.


## Resumable Upload

Request | Endpoint                                                               | Description                       |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
|GET | `upload/?file_name={file_name}&bytes_read={bytes_read}/` | file_name (**reqd**) should be a valid file name present at the server's Files directory and (**bytes_read**) should be an integer.  |
|POST | `upload/cancel/?file_name={file_name}/` | file_name (**reqd**) which is being currently uploaded  |

### Reponse

```javascript
{
  "bytes_read" : int,
}
```

### Methodology
The client makes multiple `POST` requests to the server. The client reads a block of file which it sends to the server as `text`. The server reads the `POST request body` and then sends number of bytes read to the client. While the upload is taking place, the client can pause and cancel the upload. In case of upload cancel, a `POST` request is sent to the server to delete the intermediate file formed due to the upload process.
